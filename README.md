# SONAR Rock and Mine Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting whether a sonar signal reflects off a rock or a mine. The dataset used is the UCI Machine Learning Repository's "Connectionist Bench (Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks)".

**Project Goals:**

* Build and train machine learning models to accurately classify sonar signals as rock or mine.
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
* Explore different machine learning algorithms and compare their performance.
* Document the entire process, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and results.

**Dataset:**

* The dataset consists of 60 sonar signals for each class (rock or mine).
* Each signal is a 60-dimensional vector of numerical features. 

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Normalize or standardize the features.

2. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Experiment with various machine learning algorithms:
      - Logistic Regression
      - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
      - Random Forest
      - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
      - Neural Networks
   - Train each model on the training data.
   - Tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or cross-validation.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of each model on the testing set using metrics such as:
      - Accuracy
      - Precision
      - Recall
      - F1-score
      - Confusion Matrix
   - Generate classification reports.

4. **Model Comparison and Selection:**
   - Compare the performance of different models.
   - Select the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics.

5. **Results and Visualization:**
   - Summarize the results of the analysis.
   - Visualize the results using plots (e.g., ROC curves, confusion matrices).
